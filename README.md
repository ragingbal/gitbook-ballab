Project Resourcing

● We mainly work on projects where we are the core engineering team, and provide a

fixed set of resources for the different project phases.

● In most cases we also provide the Interim-CTO role.

● The engineers and managers who work on a project are dedicated exclusively to the

project with the exclusion of QA and Systems admin staff who are only brought in when

required.

● The smallest team size at project start is normally 4 FTE. Which includes a full time

project / product manager who we expect over time to know the product as well if not

better than the customer.

● The primary technology architect is the lead engineer who stays with the project for

extended periods of time and provide continuity through the project. The lead engineers

are characterized by technology knowhow as well as their ability to understand business

issues. Lead engineers are switched out only when they have "project fatigue".

Project Approach

Based on our extensive experience working with start-ups and product companies we take a

turnkey approach to product engineering.

With projects which have an extensive UI component we will begin by drafting and simulating a

REST based API \( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational\_state\_transfer \) which in turn is

used to simulate the front-end flow of the application. This enables yourself and us to

interactively review the usability of the application at a very early stage. This phase usually lasts

around 6 weeks.

Once the UI components are firmed up the core backend implementation begins in earnest and

proceeds in tandem with the more “design related” elements of the UI \(colors, fonts, layouts,

branding etc\).

By the end of the first 6 weeks the infrastructure and hosting plan will already be in place.

Following the firming up of the initial UI flows the QA engineers begin with writing the UI test

catalog. The backend testing is based on automated testing and by test cases written by the

engineering team.

The integration of the test cases into the “build and deploy lifecycle” allow us to ensure that

changes are tested automatically before being deployed onto the live environment.

We encourage customers to target a soft launch to a small user base as early as 12 weeks

following project initiation. This allows us to get user feedback as early as possible from a

broader group.

Deployments are based on an infrastructure plan that we have deployed multiple times in

Amazon’s AWS and use a continuous integration policy. We perform benchmark tests on the

completed systems to get a better idea of the budgeting and performance of system. All servers

are monitored by Zabbix based systems and SMS based alerts\(where required\).

Technology Architecture

The foundation for most projects is provided by building on standardised frameworks such as

Spring.io \(Java\), Django and Flask \(python\), Slim and Laravel \(PHP\) in assosciation with

JavaScript Based Frameworks such as AngularJS, EmberJS and ReactJS .

By basing on a standardised framework we ensure that we can get projects bootstrapped more

quickly. We continually integrate, test and document new modules so as to save our customer’s

time and budget. All staff are trained regularly on using the framework modules.

The user interface for web and mobile projects are normally based on the popular “Twitter

Bootstrap” \( http://getbootstrap.com/ \). The foundation UI is then “styled” using CSS / SAAS.

This approach enables a high level of customisation while simultaneously enabling easy

maintenance and best practice.

All projects we build utilize the AngularJS framework\( https://angularjs.org/ \) or similar

frameworks \(EmberJS\) for managing the interactions within the UI and the communication with

the backend REST API. By taking this approach the application has a high degree of decoupling

between UI and Backend. This enables us to allow UI and Backend teams to work with a

greater degree of independence. The application is also much more structured and

maintainable.

Based on the project needs the device applications are built using a hybrid approach with native

UIs being used only where specific device functionality is not accessible from HTML5 and

JavaScript based UIs.

Depending on the nature and scale of the project we use SQL and NoSQL databases in

parallel. The SQL databases are used primarily for configuration and user information whereas

the NoSQL databases are used for maintaining information where the number of records grow

rapidly to the the 10s or 100s of millions \(usage and application logs, analytics results etc.\) . The

primary SQL database we use is MySQL\( http://www.mysql.com/ \) and NoSQL database is

Apache Cassandra\( https://cassandra.apache.org/ \) ; both of which are free and open-source

software.

We have have worked extensively in Big Data and Real Time Processing deployments using a

variety of cutting edge technologies including Hadoop, Hive, Flume, Kafka, Storm, Amazon

SQS, Drools, Undertow, Cascading.

We have over the years developed extensive experience in management of large scale server

infrastructure across multiple clouds using technologies such as OpenStack, CloudStack,

Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos, Ansible, Chef and Puppet and Terraform. Our skills are soon to be

showcased with DISTRIBOOTED a multi-cloud management platform.

Budgeting

● We charge a fixed fee per resource per month.

● The fee excludes usage of code\(github\) and task/product management\(pivotal tracker\)

infrastructure and the UI Mockup Tool - Balsamiq. There are no hidden charges.

● Invoicing is done twice a month and invoices are payable to our UAE based holding

entity.

● We exclusively use free open-source libraries, databases and platforms and therefore do

not normally expect additional charges for database licenses etc.

● An average first iteration team would consist of 4-6 resources. Teams on extensive

projects do go up to 12-14 resources. We make a projection of team size in the

pre-implementation phases of a project.

● Once a project is past its first 2 iterations and is stabilised and in maintenance mode the

resources in some projects drop to 3 resources usually consisting of a core engineer,

project manager, part-time QA and Systems Administration and monitoring.

● We encourage the customers to target a soft launch within 3-4 months in order to get

user feedback as early as possible in the product life cycle.

● A "feature stabilised" product can be targeted in 6 months following project start. Often

less.

● We use primarily Amazon's AWS as a hosting platform since it is both cost effective and

highly scalable, and has no long term contract requirements. We will scope out the

hosting costs at an early stage. All payments are made directly by customer to Amazon,

and additional server requirements are signed-off by customer. The account is managed

by our systems administrators.

● Hosting infrastructure must include at a minimum live, integration and development

environments. The development and integration environments are scaled down versions

of the live environment.

Project Management and Communication

● The primary interface between the business and engineering teams is the Project /

Product manager.

● We encourage the potential customer to spend 2 days with us in our office in Belgrade to

initiate a project. This workshop is usually attended by the engineering leads and other

team members. The purpose of the workshop is on one hand for us to get to know the

product vision and requirements better as well as for both teams to get to know each

other better.

● On-site customer visits vary by company we work with, with the most frequent being

around every 4 months. These are primarily conducted as the product moves to a new

phase and a large number of requirements need to be initiated.

● Following the initial workshop we will first work on documenting in a “lean form” the UI

and functionality requirements, the hosting requirements and the resourcing plan. We

will also propose a basic iteration plan for the project with indication of timelines for

achieving the key milestones. These are to be expected within a week of the first

workshop.

● Following project initialization the business team and the project manager will conduct

regular update calls, the frequency of which vary based on the project velocity and

customer capability. The frequency may vary from daily to once a week. The calls are

conducted on Skype.

● Customers receive a weekly report of activity on the project with updates on what was

completed in the previous week, and what is planned for the next week along with a

specific red-flag report.

● We use exclusively open source and hosted software for management tools. They

include pivotal tracker and / or trello for task management, github for source code

management, skype, google docs for text documents and spreadsheets. These afford

the customer a ring-side view of development efforts.

● While customers do to get to know the engineers working on the project directly we

encourage our customers to strictly communicate to them through the project manager.

This allows the project manager to maintain a full overview of the project.

What you can expect from us

● Our goal is to offer our customers a "no histrionics" product engineering service. We

believe software product engineering can be managed and executed with low levels of

stress and friction. You can expect to “enjoy” working with us.

● The core of this approach is based around highly pro-active, technically capable and

communicative Project Managers who are supported by well trained and equally

communicative engineers. You can expect to have a team which you will get to know

and appreciate personally and most importantly team members who intimately

understand and can drive your project.

● By basing most of our customers on standardized frameworks we ensure that engineers

can share knowhow between teams, and also be taken regularly through internal training

and test programs.

● Cutting edge technology competence: We have built our reputation on being able to

build highly complex systems based on sound engineering and business fundamentals.

You can expect from us an approach which uses the latest of technologies with a clear

purpose to build robust high quality product rapidly, but not technology for technology's

sake.

Customer References

We take pride in the fact that all our projects have come to us through customer references.

Once a potential customer discussion is in advanced stage we are happy to organize calls with

some of our customers for serving as references and talking about their experience of working

with us.
