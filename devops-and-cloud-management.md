# Services: DevOps and Cloud Management

Our expertise in DevOps and Cloud Management came out of our Software Engineering Practice. As we launched large Big Data Services into the Cloud we quickly learnt of the lack of tools and knowhow in the Market. In 2015 we launched [GridMine](http://gridmine.com) our solution for DevOps for Big Data Platforms in the market and have continually invested in developing Cloud Management Tools.

In October 2016 we launched the only Cross-Cloud Application Marketplace - [DISTRIBOOTED : The App Store for The Cloud](http://distribooted.com)

By H2-2017 we have seen DevOps and Cloud Management Projects delivering significant revenue and launched our DevOps as Service Offering.
