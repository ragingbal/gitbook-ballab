# Services: Big Data - Solutions and Infrastructure Engineering

We are the team behind the Cross Cloud Big Data Deployment Platform [GridMine](http://gridmine.com). GridMine was built to simplify the deployments of Big Data Solutions in the Cloud as well as In-House. GridMine is based on our extensive work in building Big and Fast Data Solutions for the FinTech and AdTech Verticals.

Having started out building Big Data Solutions we now offer consulting independent of our software engineering solutions. These include advisory services on Tool Choice as well as Infrastructure Design and Roadmap Planning.
